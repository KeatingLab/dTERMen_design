# dTERMen_design

Understanding the relationship between protein sequence and structure well enough to rationally
design novel proteins or protein complexes is a longstanding goal in protein science. The Protein
Data Bank (PDB) is a key resource for defining sequence-structure relationships that has
supported the development of critical resources such as rotamer libraries and backbone torsional
statistics that quantify the probabilities of protein sequences adopting different structures. Here,
we show that well-defined, non-contiguous structural motifs (TERMs) in the PDB can also
provide rich information useful for protein-peptide interaction prediction and design.
Specifically, we show that it is possible to rapidly predict the binding energies of peptides to Bcl-
2 family proteins as accurately as can be done with widely used structure-based tools, without
explicit atomistic modeling. One benefit of a TERM-based approach is that prediction
performance is less sensitive to the details of the input structure than are methods that evaluate
energies using precise atomic coordinates. Here wWe show that protein design using TERM
energies (dTERMen) can generate highly novel and diverse peptides to target anti-apoptotic
proteins Bfl-1 and Mcl-1. 15 of 17 peptides designed using dTERMen bound tightly to their
intended targets, and these peptides have just 15 - 38% sequence identity to any known native
Bcl-2 family protein ligand. High-resolution structures of four designed peptides bound to their 3
targets provided opportunities to analyze strengths and limitations of this new approach.
Dramatic success on this peptide design task, which comprised going from input structure to
experimental validation of high-affinity binders in approximately one month, provides strong
motivation for further developing TERM-based approaches to design.
